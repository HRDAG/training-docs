### Repo handling

#### **Initial**
If you intend to make contributions to a repo, we recommend cloning via ssh \
([here's how to set that up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))
- [ ] `git clone git@github.com:HRDAG/resource-utils.git`

#### **Maintenance**
_Upon returning to repo, before making changes_
- [ ] `git checkout {your-branch-name}` to make sure youâ€™re on the right branch
- [ ] `git pull` and `snap pull` to make sure you have most recent updates

_Before leaving repo, after making changes_
- [] `git add` the changed files along with a message about the changes in a `git commit`
- [ ] `git push` changes to the remote repo
- [ ] If tracking with snap, `snap add` with a commit message and then `snap push` to eleanor

# done.
