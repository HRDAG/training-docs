### Scripts

#### Style requirements
_Script contains:_
- [] Standard script header and footer, including path/to/here
- [] Double-spaces between functions and class definitions
- [] Single-space within code
- [] Logical function and variable names

_Script does NOT contain:_
- [] Commented code
- [] Space around variable names as arguments in parentheses
- [] Unused modules
- [] Remnants of abandoned approaches/methods

#### Core logic requirements
- [] Assert statements that trace I/O along function calls and manipulations
- [] Logging of data characteristics, manipulations performed, and reports 
- [] Digestible and readily debuggable units of code
    - [] Multiple small scripts instead of a single long script
- [] Ideal solutions per the corresponding language's guide in the "Tips & Tricks" doc
