# Setting up git and GitHub

Git is a way of keeping track of changes inside a repository so that you can revert to previous versions and join your work with others. It's not totally ideal for our sort of data work, but it's the industry standard and so we use it. (We supplement it with our own version control system called `snap`, but that's a different lesson.)

GitHub is a website that provides a pretty interface for git, and makes collaboration with organizations easier. We use it for most projects at HRDAG.

## Set up steps

Git is likely already installed on your computer, so mostly you'll just need to set up GitHub.

1. Get a GitHub account (https://github.com/join).
2. Connect your GitHub account with an ssh key (https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Your SSH key lets GitHub know that you are who you say you are when asking for files. It's like a more-secure password that you don't have to remember.

That's it!
