# Reading List
Resources and suggested readings for the tools used at HRDAG.

## Workflow
At HRDAG we organize our work in tasks (see `06-tasks.md`). If you're ever in doubt about project organization, [The Task Is A Quantum Of Workflow](https://hrdag.org/2016/06/14/the-task-is-a-quantum-of-workflow/) is a good reference. For an explanation about why HRDAG does **not** use the `.Rproj` tool in RStudio, see our post [.Rproj considered harmful](https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/harmful.html). 

## Markdown
A language for writing (this document is written in Markdown). Markdown files end with `.md`. 

- [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) has all of the information you need to get started writing and formatting text in no time.

## `R` & R Markdown
At HRDAG we tend to use [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) tools for data analysis in `R` as much as possible. We like the tidyverse because tidyverse packages are well developed and maintained. These tools use a common grammar that simplifies writing code that is clear to read and easily allows for multiple commands to be chained together.

- Get started with this [introduction to tidy data principles](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/01-intro.md) to understand what it means for data to be "tidy".
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) ([R para Ciencia de Datos](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) en espa√±ol) is the go-to tidyverse textbook. There's a lot of information covered in the textbook and it would be great to read all of it if you have the time, but we suggest getting started with:
    - Chapter 2
    - Chapter 4
    - Chapter 5 (don't forget the exercises!)
    - Chapter 7 (don't forget the exercises!)
- R Markdown is a flavor of Markdown made especially for use with `R`. R Markdown files end with `.Rmd`. We use R Markdown because it lets us combine prose and code and we can write reports that automatically update if our results change (rather than hard coding numbers or graphs). [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) is our go-to textbook for this. R Markdown can be used in many different ways, but Chapters 1 and 2 are sufficient to get started.

## Vim and the language of editing

[_Practical Vim_](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/) is one of the best programming books I (PB) have ever read. I think there is a PDF that some of the training team colleagues have. I very strong encourage you to study it closely.
