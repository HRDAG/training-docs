# HRDAG Training

This repo contains training materials for HRDAG colleagues. As you read, you'll likely encounter questions, and as you try things in practice, you'll run into incomprehensible errors.

If this happens to you, after a few minutes of trying to fix it, you should ask for help! One of your colleagues may have seen the error you're trying to deal with, or be familiar with related problems.

## Before you ask for help

The reason it's good to try to solve the problem on your own (besides the fact that you might actually fix it) is that it will help you clarify your question. A few minutes poking around might reveal that what you thought was an issue with your ssh config is actually a problem with your bashrc. You may still not know *what* the problem is, but it'll be easier for someone to help.

Here are some tips on bug-fixing:
* Copy and paste the relevant part of the error message into Google
* Search the issues in [this repository](https://github.com/HRDAG/training-docs/issues). As of August 2022, there aren't that many, so you might even glance through all the titles and see if there's anything relevant.
* If it's in a script, try commenting out the offending line and see if you get a different, interesting error

The amount of time you spend trying to solve your problem before you ask for help should gradually get longer. In the beginning, don't spend more than 5 minutes, but that will naturally become 15, 30, or 120 minutes.

## Asking for help

When you do ask for help, the best place is to [make a new issue](https://github.com/HRDAG/training-docs/issues/new) in this repository. That way, future HRDAG people can benefit from your knowledge.

Here are some guidelines for asking good questions:
* explain why you are trying to do what you're doing. There might be a tool that fits the problem better.
* if you're trying to fix an error, copy and paste the entire error message into the question. Use markdown's block-code feature (enclose the error message in `` ``` ``s) to retain formatting.
* describe the steps you've already taken, and what the results were.

Have fun, and ask away!
