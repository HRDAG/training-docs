# What is a MakeFile? 

A MakeFile is a file to compile code. We have one of them for each of the tasks that we create in our data analysis. We locate it inside of a task but outside of any of the directories (input, output, src, hand, frozen).

# What should it look like?

1. It must always contain a header as any other text file we are creating containing:

Author: 
Maintainers:
Date: Oct. 16 2019
License: 
 ------
path

2. Then you must follow this structure:

2.1 For R

.PHONY: all clean
 
all:  path(s) to the output
 
clean:
	rm output/*
 
path to the output1: \
		script for creating that output 
	Rscript --vanilla $<
 
path to the output1: \
		script for creating that output 
	Rscript --vanilla $< 

3. Example 

We want to create a MakeFile for our task "append" in our data analysis about social movement leaders killings in Colombia. The output will be a database with all of the different years we have. We will also create a logfile with basic information that we will use later in our report.
