# training-docs
This repo contains materials to study and learn about principled data processing, including:
- `onboarding` materials to help you get setup with the right tools and procedures
- `demo-tasks` to walk-through how to use some of those tools in practice
- `templates` to serve as outlines for routine files like Makefiles and scripts in python or R
- `checklists` to refer to as you work and contribute to projects (updating a repo, writing a script, adding a new task)
- `languages` and language-specific tips to consider when writing scripts (like scalability, missingness)
- `notebooks` to walk-through various topics in context of a specific language (ie. set operations in python)
